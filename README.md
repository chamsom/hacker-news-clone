# hacker-news-clone
Project built with Vanilla JS and HTML/CSS.

Finished this summer project in hopes of furthering my studies in FE Web Development. As the repo title implies, the project is an attempt at emulating the well-known social news website, Hacker News. 

Real-time data is requested from an API endpoint and state management is done via reducers.
